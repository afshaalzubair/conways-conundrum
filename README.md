# conways-conundrum

## Welcome to Conway's Conundrum!
Conway's Conundrum is a project I've recently been working on. It is a twist on the famous cellular automaton "Conway's Game of Life", 
allowing the user to experiment with a wide variety of custom parameters to create novel simulations.

Feel free to check out the [images](https://github.com/afshaalzubair/conways-conundrum/tree/main/images) folder to view
cool sample results of interesting parameter combinations!

Also check out the [saved_statistics](https://github.com/afshaalzubair/conways-conundrum/tree/main/saved_statistics) folder to view
generated statistical data for sample simulations.

## List of features to add:
- Ability for user to set experimental parameters

## Completed features:
- ~~Color gradient and age function of cell~~
- ~~Default RGB colors imported from a file~~
- ~~Add json file for default experimental parameters~~
- ~~Openable controls menu~~
- ~~Openable interactive statistics menu~~
- ~~Cell death from aging mechanic~~
- ~~Openable introduction panel~~
- ~~Openable rules/explanation menu explaining the basics of CGOL~~
- ~~Saveable screenshot~~
- ~~Saveable plot statistics data with parameters, directory saving system~~
